I created a 20 minute video in which I go through my code, what it ultimately is supposed to do, and the fundamentals behind it. It revolves around 3 testing algorithims
One of my simulations represents the normal game of Are You The One. I want to show how this simulation, over the course of a couple hundred or thousand games,
takes a very long time to finish the game. It takes a very high amount of rounds in order to finish the game. I created 2 other simulations and optimized them using 
different testing algorithims and methods to find pairing, in hopes of being able to reduce this very high average number of rounds. The end goal is to print out a graph
and time table that showcases all 3 simulations side by side and compare their average amount of rounds over the course of many games.
