To finish up my project, I added code to calculate the average rounds it took for each of my testing algorithims of Are You The One to test which algorithims
on average proved to be the fastest, most efficient and end simulations of Are You The One in the least number of rounds as opposed to the 
most number of rounds. This will help indicate whether or not our goal was ultimately successful: proving that the normal way to play Are You The One
is very time-consuming and takes many rounds to finish and that my testing algorithims will reduce the amount of time and rounds it takes on average
to finish one simulation of are you the one. I used matplotlib in Python to graph this data for a visual representation of the scenario for easier
understanding and analysis.
